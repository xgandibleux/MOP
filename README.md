# j2objSimplex
Academic simplex with two objectives.

This code is an extended version of the single objective simplex algorithm's implementation described in chapter 5 of [Julia programming for Operations Research (Changhyun Kwon)](http://www.chkwon.net/julia/). 

This version corresponds to the simplex parametric which handles two linear objectives.

This implementation has been done for teaching purposes. Comments are partially written in french.
