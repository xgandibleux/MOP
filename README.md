# j2objSimplex
An academic and minimalist implementation of the simplex algorithm with two linear objectives.

This code is an extended version of the single objective simplex algorithm's implementation described in chapter 5 of [Julia programming for Operations Research (Changhyun Kwon)](http://www.chkwon.net/julia/). 

This version corresponds to the simplex parametric which handles two linear objectives.

This implementation has been done for teaching purposes. Comments are partially written in french. Notations are compliant with the lecture notes of "Integer Programming" (track "optimization in operations research" of the master in computer science, University of Nantes, France).
