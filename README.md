# j2objSimplex
Academic simplex with two objectives.

This code is an extended version of the single objective simplex algorithm's implementation described in "Julia programming for Operations Research (Changhyun Kwon)". 

ComThis code is based on the (single objective) simplex algorithm's implementation described in "Julia programming for Operations Research ( by Changhyun Kwon)". This version corresponds to the simplex parametric which handles two linear objectives.
